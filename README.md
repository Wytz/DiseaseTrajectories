Here you find the reference sets and classification code for to computationally identify disease trajectories.
The feature sets can be obtained (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T2y7l98w8k_I4aLH1TdSGkFnVV4mjDxk?usp=sharing)[here].

The general classification code is "Classify.R", while the paired t-test code is setSeedsForClassification.

The code that was used to extract the data upon which the feature sets are based is specific to the Euretos Knowledge Platform, and can be supplied upon request.
